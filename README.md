# RSA 

You're gonna need some research for this one. 

## Difficulty

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

## Writeup

Use Yafu to find all the primes of N then use it to find phi(N). The rest is the same as a normal RSA decryption.

The script to solve is in solution/solve.py

## Flag

`STRT{MuLt1_prIm3_RSA_is_s4f3_they_say}`
